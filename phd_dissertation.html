Super-resolution imaging is the process whereby several
low-resolution photographs of an object are combined to form a single
high-resolution estimation.  We investigate each component of this process:
image acquisition, registration and reconstruction.  A new feature detector,
based on the discrete pulse transform, is developed. We show how to implement
and store the transform efficiently, and how to match the features using a
statistical comparison that improves upon correlation under mild geometric
transformation.  To simplify reconstruction, the imaging model is linearised,
whereafter a polygon-based interpolation operator is introduced to model the
underlying camera sensor. Finally, a large, sparse, over-determined system of
linear equations is solved, using regularisation. The software developed to
perform these computations is made available under an open source license, and
may be used to verify the results.
