This thesis describes techniques proposed for analysing images of borehole
cores. We address two problems: first, the automated stratigraphic
classification of cores based on texture and second, the location of thin
chromitite layers hidden in pyroxenite cores. Texture features of different
rock types are extracted using wavelets, the theory of which provides an
intuitive and powerful tool for this purpose. A Bayesian classifier is
trained and used to discriminate between different samples. Thin, planar
chromitite layers are located using a shortest path algorithm. In order to
estimate the physical orientation of any layer found, a sinusoidal curve is
fitted. The proposed algorithms were implemented and tested on samples taken
from photographed cores. A high success rate was obtained in rock
classification, and thin planar layers were located and characterised.
