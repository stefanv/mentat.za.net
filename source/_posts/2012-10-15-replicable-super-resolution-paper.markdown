While I loved the topic of my PhD, I had to take a break after staring at that
problem for several years.  Thereafter, I was side-tracked by
[several](http://github.com/scipy) [other](http://scikit-image.org)
[projects](http://dipy.org), and never got around to publishing a paper on
[my dissertation][thesis].

Here, then, is a summary of the simple but effective super-resolution algorithm
described therein:

I also submitted this work to NIPS: the reviewers liked the paper, but they
were not convinced of its novelty.  Having spent a lot of time studying the
existing literature, all I can say in response is that, while solving the
problem as a sparse linear system was well known at the time, phrasing Drizzle
as a linear operator and using it for super-resolution was not.

But the proof of the pudding is in the eating! Have a look at the
[results and published code][supreme] -- you can download it all (including a
sample data-set) and play with the different reconstruction parameters.  Quite
a bit of the code has since graduated into [scikit-image][].
