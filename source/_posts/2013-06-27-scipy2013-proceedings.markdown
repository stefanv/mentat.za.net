The talks for the 12th (fantastic) Python in Science conference just concluded,
and I am happy to announce the
[conference proceedings](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/380268/scipy_2013_proceedings_draft.pdf).

This may come as a surprize to some, since in the past we have been unable to
publish the proceedings in a timely manner.  So, what changed?

## Review process

For 2013 we followed a **very light-weight review process, via comments on
GitHub pull-requests**.  This change has an important consequence: in contrast
to the traditional review process, where reviewers critically pull apart
papers, the process now changes into a constructive conversation--the reviewer
becomes an ally to the author, helping them to get their paper signed off on.

In addition, this is a very familiar process to most members of our community
who regularly collaborate to open source projects.  Most such projects nowadays
follow a similar methodology for discussing and integrating patches.

## Tools

Since we can't expect reviewers to check out and build the papers themselves, a
[paper build bot](http://stefan.pythonanywhere.com) is provided to generate
PDFs from pull-requests, which contain papers in plain-text ReStructuredText
format (see the
[proceedings repository](https://github.com/scipy/scipy_proceedings/tree/2013) for
examples, and all papers starting 2010).

For authors, tools are provided to convert the ReStructuredText papers to
PDFs in IEEE Computer Society paper style.

## Help us with the final review

We welcome your feedback on the proceedings!  If you spot a mistake, please
submit a pull request on
[GitHub](https://github.com/scipy/scipy_proceedings/tree/2013).

## Thanks

Finally, a big shout-out to the amazing team of people who organized this
year's conference, and to the wonderfully inclusive and talented Scientific
Python community, of which I am proud to be part of.
