Adobe yesterday
[released its free and open source Type family, Source Code Pro][scp-release],
which includes an eye-pleasing monospace font  ideally suited for coding.
In the past, and at the recommendation of [Fernando Perez][fperez], I've
used the beautiful (but non-free) [Consolas by Microsoft][consolas]; now,
which is best?

To install on Linux:

 1. [Grab the font][scp-download].
 2. Copy the files to ``~/.fonts``.
 3. Run ``fc-cache -f -v``.

The font should now be available for selection in apps such as Firefox, Gnome
Terminal, etc.  To make it the default font in Emacs::

```common-lisp
    (set-default-font "Source Code Pro")
```

Here's a comparison of Consolas (left) and Source Code Pro (right):
