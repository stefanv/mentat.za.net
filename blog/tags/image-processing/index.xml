      <description>Today, I presented a talk titled &amp;ldquo;Scientific Python: A Mature Computational Ecosystem for Microscopy&amp;rdquo; [PDF] at the Microscopy and MicroAnalysis conference in Portland.
A few members of the audience familiar with scientific Python told me they had learned something, so I&amp;rsquo;ll highlight the few topics that I think may have qualified.
SciPy 1.0 paper The first official release of SciPy was in 2001, and a mere 16 years later we reached 1.</description>

      <description>While I loved the topic of my PhD, I had to take a break after staring at that problem for several years. Thereafter, I was side-tracked by several other projects, and never got around to publishing a paper on my dissertation.
Here, then, is a summary of the simple but effective super-resolution algorithm described therein:

I also submitted this work to NIPS: the reviewers liked the paper, but they were not convinced of its novelty.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re happy to announce the 7th version of scikits-image!
Scikits-image is an image processing toolbox for SciPy that includes algorithms for segmentation, geometric transformations, color space manipulation, analysis, filtering, morphology, feature detection, and more.
For more information, examples, and documentation, please visit our website.
New Features It&amp;rsquo;s been only 3 months since scikits-image 0.6 was released, but in that short time, we&amp;rsquo;ve managed to add plenty of new features and enhancements, including</description>
