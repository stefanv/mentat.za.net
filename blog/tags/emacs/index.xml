      <description>Update 2018-11-2: Change the URL scheme to message://. See &amp;ldquo;Other Systems&amp;rdquo; below.
org-mode is, to me, is one of the most valuable parts of the emacs ecosystem. I use it to take notes, plan projects, manage tasks, and write &amp;amp; publish documents.
Nowadays, a lot of work arrives via email, and so it is helpful to be able to refer to messages directly from my notes or lists of tasks.</description>

      <title>Search headers in org-mode</title>

      <description>In org-mode, I often have the need to jump to a top-level heading matching some word.
Since an org-mode buffer can be searched just like any other, I can simply invoke forward search with C-s, but this will match all occurrences of the text, instead of limiting the search to headings only.
This makes it hard to search for a phrase like &amp;ldquo;Travel&amp;rdquo;, for which I have a top-level heading, but also often occurs elsewhere in my notes.</description>

      <title>Adobe&#39;s new free font: Source Code Pro</title>

      <description>Adobe yesterday released its free and open source Type family, Source Code Pro, which includes an eye-pleasing monospace font ideally suited for coding. In the past, and at the recommendation of Fernando Perez, I&amp;rsquo;ve used the beautiful (but non-free) Consolas by Microsoft; now, which is best?
To install on Linux:
 Grab the font. Copy the files to ~/.fonts. Run fc-cache -f -v.  The font should now be available for selection in apps such as Firefox, Gnome Terminal, etc.</description>

      <title>Emacs package management</title>

      <description>I recently tried to install MuMaMo as one of the dependencies for Takafumi Arakaki&amp;rsquo;s Emacs-based IPython notebook. The instructions on the MuMaMo webpage were as clear as mud and aimed primarily at Windows users. Enters apt-get for Emacs!
My Emacs setup is shared across multiple machines: a synchronized elisp folder, containing *.el files, along with my .emacs configuration. el-get allows you to share your package installation folder in a similar fashion.</description>
