      <description>Recently, a colleague of mine was agitated by a comment I left during a code review. Who could blame them: I had asked them to motivate an implementation choice that still didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to me&amp;mdash;after numerous rounds of discussion.
To their great credit, they were supremely polite about it:
 Thanks for checking in. Overall, I really appreciate your reviews and feedback. At times, I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling frustrated that I&amp;rsquo;m having to address comments that aren&amp;rsquo;t relevant.</description>
