      <description>Recently, a colleague of mine was agitated by a comment I left during a code review. Who could blame them: I had asked them to motivate an implementation choice that still didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to me&amp;mdash;after numerous rounds of discussion.
To their great credit, they were supremely polite about it:
 Thanks for checking in. Overall, I really appreciate your reviews and feedback. At times, I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling frustrated that I&amp;rsquo;m having to address comments that aren&amp;rsquo;t relevant.</description>

      <description>Adobe yesterday released its free and open source Type family, Source Code Pro, which includes an eye-pleasing monospace font ideally suited for coding. In the past, and at the recommendation of Fernando Perez, I&amp;rsquo;ve used the beautiful (but non-free) Consolas by Microsoft; now, which is best?
To install on Linux:
 Grab the font. Copy the files to ~/.fonts. Run fc-cache -f -v.  The font should now be available for selection in apps such as Firefox, Gnome Terminal, etc.</description>
