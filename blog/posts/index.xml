      <description>Recently, a colleague of mine was agitated by a comment I left during a code review. Who could blame them: I had asked them to motivate an implementation choice that still didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to me&amp;mdash;after numerous rounds of discussion.
To their great credit, they were supremely polite about it:
 Thanks for checking in. Overall, I really appreciate your reviews and feedback. At times, I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling frustrated that I&amp;rsquo;m having to address comments that aren&amp;rsquo;t relevant.</description>

      <title>Voice capture org-mode tasks on Android</title>

      <description>I often want to capture tasks on the go—in a hurry. When there&amp;rsquo;s no time to fire up organice or http://www.orgzly.com/, being able to transcribe tasks comes in really handy.
In this post, I show how, on Android phones, you can hook up Google&amp;rsquo;s Assistant with org-mode, so that you can speak notes and have them appear as TODO items in a buffer.
Set up Google Assistant First, we need to teach Google Assistant a new keyword, and tell it to store transcribed notes in an accessible location.</description>

      <description>Today, I presented a talk titled &amp;ldquo;Scientific Python: A Mature Computational Ecosystem for Microscopy&amp;rdquo; [PDF] at the Microscopy and MicroAnalysis conference in Portland.
A few members of the audience familiar with scientific Python told me they had learned something, so I&amp;rsquo;ll highlight the few topics that I think may have qualified.
SciPy 1.0 paper The first official release of SciPy was in 2001, and a mere 16 years later we reached 1.</description>

      <description>The first issue of the Harvard Data Science Review was published last month. I enjoyed Michael Jordan&amp;rsquo;s opinion piece, in which he considers progress made (and, yes, hype!) in so-called artificial intelligence. Particularly, I was excited about the phrase &amp;ldquo;Intelligent Augmentation&amp;rdquo;—the pursuit of systems that enhances our ability to reason about a subject, by providing additional analysis, data, and emphasis. Jordan writes:
 IA will also remain quite essential, because for the foreseeable future, computers will not be able to match humans in their ability to reason abstractly about real-world situations.</description>

      <title>Linking to emails in org-mode (using neomutt)</title>

      <description>Update 2018-11-2: Change the URL scheme to message://. See &amp;ldquo;Other Systems&amp;rdquo; below.
org-mode is, to me, is one of the most valuable parts of the emacs ecosystem. I use it to take notes, plan projects, manage tasks, and write &amp;amp; publish documents.
Nowadays, a lot of work arrives via email, and so it is helpful to be able to refer to messages directly from my notes or lists of tasks.</description>

      <title>Search headers in org-mode</title>
      <link>https://mentat.za.net/blog/2016/12/15/org-mode-header-search/</link>

      <guid>https://mentat.za.net/blog/2016/12/15/org-mode-header-search/</guid>
      <description>In org-mode, I often have the need to jump to a top-level heading matching some word.
Since an org-mode buffer can be searched just like any other, I can simply invoke forward search with C-s, but this will match all occurrences of the text, instead of limiting the search to headings only.
This makes it hard to search for a phrase like &amp;ldquo;Travel&amp;rdquo;, for which I have a top-level heading, but also often occurs elsewhere in my notes.</description>

      <description>As part of our work on Cesium and its web frontend, we&amp;rsquo;ve developed an easy mechanism for Python web developers to push messages from their Python backends to the browser.
There are plenty of potential use cases, but consider, e.g., that you want to verify a credit card number submitted by your user. Traditionally, you&amp;rsquo;d submit the number, and then poll the backend repeatedly from the browser. Not very elegant :/</description>

      <title>Compile TensorFlow from source with gcc6.1</title>

      <description>Due to two bugs in gcc 6.1 affecting the re2 library (one of which has been fixed in 6.2)), TensorFlow cannot be compiled from source one some systems (including my Debian Testing install).
To work around the issue, modify tensorflow/workspace.bzl and change the re2 description to:
native.git_repository( name = &amp;quot;com_googlesource_code_re2&amp;quot;, remote = &amp;quot;https://github.com/stefanv/re2.git&amp;quot;, commit = &amp;quot;86503cb89d82b723ae0bce35e1e09524910cd319&amp;quot;, ) The re2 library is now downloaded from my fork, which applies a one line patch.</description>

      <description>Did you know that Amazon does not sell ebooks? But, wait, you say, I have bought ebooks from them myself! Sadly, that is not the case. I will summarize part of the Kindle Store Terms of Use quoted at the bottom of this post:
 You do not own any Kindle book that you have &amp;ldquo;bought&amp;rdquo;, even if it said &amp;ldquo;buy with one click&amp;rdquo; in the store (the book still belongs to Amazon, you&amp;rsquo;re just leasing it).</description>

      <description>One day, we will hopefully have a grand unified build and package management system for Python where everything is free &amp;amp; open and Just Works (TM). Until then, you have two options:
brew Python + pip  brew install python3 pyvenv -v ~/envs/py3 source ~/envs/py3/bin/activate pip install matplotlib  Pros/cons:
 Pip is the standard Python package management tool, and uses the official Python Package Index (PyPi) repository. Wheels on PyPi are built by authors themselves from open recipes.</description>

      <title>VPN-only access to the internet</title>

      <description>A few days ago, I noticed that my outbound email wasn&amp;rsquo;t being delivered&amp;mdash;it seems as if my ISP blocks access to some outbound ports. An easy workaround is to route traffic through the work VPN, but knowing myself I&amp;rsquo;d forget to switch it on, leaving my outbound mail stranded.
I needed a way of blocking any access to the internet, unless it was leaving through the VPN (since I was sure I&amp;rsquo;d notice that pretty quickly).</description>

      <description>Visualizing the Docker image dependency tree is a useful way of checking image sizes and inter-image dependencies. Since images occupy a lot of disk space, we may also want to prune unused images.
Visualizing image dependencies In version 1.2.0 of Docker, the image dependency tree is available via the docker images --tree command:
$ docker images --tree Warning: &#39;--tree&#39; is deprecated, it will be removed soon. See usage. ├─511136ea3c5a Virtual Size: 0 B │ ├─5bc37dc2dfba Virtual Size: 192.</description>

      <description>The talks for the 12th (fantastic) Python in Science conference just concluded, and I am happy to announce the conference proceedings.
This may come as a surprize to some, since in the past we have been unable to publish the proceedings in a timely manner. So, what changed?
Review process For 2013 we followed a very light-weight review process, via comments on GitHub pull-requests. This change has an important consequence: in contrast to the traditional review process, where reviewers critically pull apart papers, the process now changes into a constructive conversation&amp;ndash;the reviewer becomes an ally to the author, helping them to get their paper signed off on.</description>

      <description>While I loved the topic of my PhD, I had to take a break after staring at that problem for several years. Thereafter, I was side-tracked by several other projects, and never got around to publishing a paper on my dissertation.
Here, then, is a summary of the simple but effective super-resolution algorithm described therein:
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.3404
I also submitted this work to NIPS: the reviewers liked the paper, but they were not convinced of its novelty.</description>

      <description>Adobe yesterday released its free and open source Type family, Source Code Pro, which includes an eye-pleasing monospace font ideally suited for coding. In the past, and at the recommendation of Fernando Perez, I&amp;rsquo;ve used the beautiful (but non-free) Consolas by Microsoft; now, which is best?
To install on Linux:
 Grab the font. Copy the files to ~/.fonts. Run fc-cache -f -v.  The font should now be available for selection in apps such as Firefox, Gnome Terminal, etc.</description>

      <description>I recently tried to install MuMaMo as one of the dependencies for Takafumi Arakaki&amp;rsquo;s Emacs-based IPython notebook. The instructions on the MuMaMo webpage were as clear as mud and aimed primarily at Windows users. Enters apt-get for Emacs!
My Emacs setup is shared across multiple machines: a synchronized elisp folder, containing *.el files, along with my .emacs configuration. el-get allows you to share your package installation folder in a similar fashion.</description>
