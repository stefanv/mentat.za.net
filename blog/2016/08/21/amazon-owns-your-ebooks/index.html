		<p>Did you know that Amazon does not sell ebooks?  But, wait, you say, I
have bought ebooks from them myself!  Sadly, that is not the case.  I
will summarize part of the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201014950">Kindle Store Terms of Use</a> quoted
at the bottom of this post:</p>
<ol>
<li>You do not own any Kindle book that you have &ldquo;bought&rdquo;, even if it
said &ldquo;buy with one click&rdquo; in the store (the book still belongs to
Amazon, you&rsquo;re just leasing it).</li>
<li>You may only read Kindle content through sofware approved by
Amazon.</li>
<li>You may not copy ebooks &ldquo;bought&rdquo; from Amazon to other devices (such
as a Kobo or Nook reader).  In fact, you may not engage in any
activity that bypasses their Digital Rights Management (or DRM).</li>
</ol>
<p>I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bought<!-- raw HTML omitted --> rent more than 120 Kindle books, and to my shame
only realized the invasive nature of these terms now.</p>
<p>Since your agreement with Amazon is simply a license to view material,
they have the ability to withdraw that right whenever they choose.
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/18/technology/companies/18amazon.html">Which they have done, in an ironic twist, with George Orwell&rsquo;s 1984</a>.</p>
<p>As you may imagine, this whole situation riles me up quite badly, and
spoils many a dinner-time conversation (sorry, friends).  I am
particularly irate because I just bought myself a beautiful
<a href="http://www.cnet.com/products/kobo-glo-hd/">Kobo Glo HD</a>, in a slow
but measured move to lessen my dependence on Amazon.  Now, lo and
behold, I cannot access any of the 120 books which, if I gave my money
to other ebook stores, I would have owned!</p>
<p>So, <em>caveat emptor</em>, dear reader.  <strong>Do not support Amazon&rsquo;s great
<a href="https://www.defectivebydesign.org/amazon-kindle-swindle">Kindle Swindle</a></strong>.</p>
<p>If you buy books from Kobo, you will be able to export your books to
your Kindle devices, albeit encumbered by Digital Rights Management (DRM).</p>
<h2 id="the-deal-with-digital-rights-management-drm">The deal with Digital Rights Management (DRM)</h2>
<p>While this post is about Amazon Kindle, it is worth mentioning Digital
Rights Management (DRM).  DRM is a mechanism that distributers use to
lock their books so that you may not easily copy it illegally.  Of
course, and very predictably, the DRM is not difficult to circumvent,
and those who want to steal electronic books do so with impunity.
Still, it is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-circumvention#Fair_Use_and_Circumvention">probably illegal to remove DRM in the United States</a>,
and if you&rsquo;re a law abiding citizen, you cannot convert a protected
ebook to another format such as PDF, even if a PDF would be more
convenient for you.</p>
<p>Some distributors are worse than others, though, and unsurprisingly
Amazon is one of the worst.  Not only do they lock their books (making
it difficult to copy to other devices), but they use a proprietary
format (.mobi) that only works on <em>their</em> readers.  If you want to
copy their books to another device, you <em>have</em> to first remove the DRM
which, as their terms state, is not allowed.  You might start to
wonder whether such business practices aren&rsquo;t anti-competitive and
perhaps even illegal.</p>
<p>There is a perfectly usable format for ebooks already in existence
(.epub), that is also supported by many different models of readers.
So, while locking books with some kind of DRM is far from ideal, it is
still preferable to using a proprietary format to boot.</p>
<p>For those buying from the Kobo store, some of the books on their
shelves are available DRM-free, and is indicated as follows:</p>
