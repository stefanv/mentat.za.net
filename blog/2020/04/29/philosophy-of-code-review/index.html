		<p>Recently, a colleague of mine was agitated by a comment I left during a code review.  Who could blame them: I had asked them to motivate an implementation choice that still didn&rsquo;t make sense to me&mdash;after numerous rounds of discussion.</p>
<p>To their great credit, they were supremely polite about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for checking in. Overall, I really appreciate your reviews and feedback. At times, I&rsquo;ve been feeling frustrated that I&rsquo;m having to address comments that aren&rsquo;t relevant. With the current circumstances of not being able to talk things over in person, this has been feeling like an inefficient use of both of our limited cycles right now. I really respect and appreciate your perspective and feedback.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but think back to when I learned unit testing. Initially, it seemed like a lot of work, but once the impact of it dawned, there was no turning back.  In this case, I felt like I had not clearly communicated my philosophy around code review, and that doing so would change this from an adverserial to a cooperative conversation.</p>
<p>Here, then, follows is a summary of my philosophy around code review.</p>
<h2 id="why-code-review-is-important">Why Code Review is Important</h2>
<h2 id="why-code-review-is-complicated">Why Code Review is Complicated</h2>
<h2 id="heading"></h2>
<p>This made me consider why code review is important to me, how to share my philosophy so as to</p>
<p>This kicked off a conversation (still ongoing),</p>
<p>Thanks for the honest feedback.  I&rsquo;d like to explain my motivation for
doing code review, which perhaps may help you to consider my feedback
in a charitable light, even when it feels frustrating.</p>
<p>My primary goal with code review is to minimize future work for both
of us.  For this to be effective, several things have to be true: 1)
The reviewer has to understand the code they&rsquo;re reading 2) They have
to make an estimate of the code&mdash;in terms of simplicity,
applicability, and future-proofing and 3) They have to convince
themselves that all design decisions were justified.</p>
<p>Why am I so concerned with all these things: well, the primary
motivation is my own failings at being a perfect programmer.  No
matter how hard I try, I introduce errors in PRs, and design decisions
which seem brilliant in the moment often have large caveats.  So,
whatever comments I make on PRs should never be read as &ldquo;I think I
know how to do this better&rdquo;, but as the question &ldquo;has this specific
aspect of the problem received due consideration&rdquo;.  The answer, many
times, will be &ldquo;yes, and here&rsquo;s why I did it that way&rdquo;&mdash;absolutely
okay!</p>
<p>Coding is a technical but also an aesthetic endeavor.  As such, as
much as our understanding guides us, we also intuit whether a piece of
code does something &ldquo;right&rdquo;, where &ldquo;right&rdquo; can mean: simply as
possible, efficiently as possible, with the right level of
generalization, etc.  But, it remains a feeling, and there is no
absolute right or wrong.</p>
<p>So, where that brings us is this: I read your code, and most of the
time it makes sense.  Sometimes, it doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;often because I don&rsquo;t
quite understand the problem, or because I missed something (like that
it was a POST and not a GET method :slightly_smiling_face:).  The hope
is that the slightly noise review is worth it for the rare event in
which I catch something that is not quite the way it should be, with
full knowledge that, most of the time, you will have to take the time
to explain to me what is going on.  But, if the decision was
well-reasoned, hopefully that goes quickly (hence all the &ldquo;oh, yeah,
that makes sense&quot;s and &ldquo;resolved&quot;s).</p>
<p>Now, I can tweak the slider and be more conservative in when I query a
line of code or a decision.  With beginners, like the students, we
have to keep a much closer eye on what happens, whereas with you or
me, who have more experience, we can be a bit more lax.  But, I still
believe that the benefit of identifying issues that may cause major
refactors later is so important, that strict code review benefits us
in the long run.  And, not only big issues.  A growing project like
SkyPortal can easily succumb to death by a thousand cuts, if we don&rsquo;t
ensure that we write code that doesn&rsquo;t have to be modified and fixed
up all the time.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;gut feel&rdquo; when reviewing isn&rsquo;t always reliable.  But, in cases
like the DB structure, a conversation last night on the team call was
quite informative.  Our understanding of what needed to happen around
candidates wasn&rsquo;t quite right, and it was going to cause a lot of
unnecessary complexity down the lines.  I realize that feedback like
as &ldquo;this doesn&rsquo;t feel quite right&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t exactly satisfying, but if a
team member feels that way, it often means that we have not
sufficiently communicated either requirements or the justification for
the proposed implementation.  Especially in times of reduced cycles,
being on the same page feels important to me.</p>
<p>OK, so I wrote a lot, but it may not address your concerns, or may
make me come across as a smug know-it-all (I hope not!)  Please
continue to reach out&mdash;I&rsquo;d be happy to chat more, here or via video.</p>
<p>Most importantly: I thank you for your patience, and for educating me
during review of your work.  I cannot promise to always know what is
going on, but I can promise to do my best to learn!</p>
