    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While I loved the topic of my PhD, I had to take a break after staring at that
problem for several years.  Thereafter, I was side-tracked by
<a href="http://github.com/scipy">several</a> <a href="http://scikit-image.org">other</a>
<a href="http://dipy.org">projects</a>, and never got around to publishing a paper on
<a href="http://mentat.za.net/phd_dissertation.html">my dissertation</a>.</p>

<p>Here, then, is a summary of the simple but effective super-resolution algorithm
described therein:</p>

<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.3404">http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.3404</a></p>

<p>I also submitted this work to NIPS: the reviewers liked the paper, but they
were not convinced of its novelty.  Having spent a lot of time studying the
existing literature, all I can say in response is that, while solving the
problem as a sparse linear system was well known at the time, phrasing Drizzle
as a linear operator and using it for super-resolution was not.</p>

<p>But the proof of the pudding is in the eating! Have a look at the
<a href="http://mentat.za.net/supreme">results and published code</a> -- you can download it all (including a
sample data-set) and play with the different reconstruction parameters.  Quite
a bit of the code has since graduated into <a href="http://scikit-image.org">scikit-image</a>.</p>
